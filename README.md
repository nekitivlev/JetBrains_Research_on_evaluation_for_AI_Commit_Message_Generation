# Multi-label Commit Classification 
## Description
Fine-tuned model for commit texts classification based on the [Multi-label Classification of Commit Messages Using Transfer Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohamed-Wiem-Mkaouer-2/publication/348228961_Multi-label_Classification_of_Commit_Messages_using_Transfer_Learning/links/61eacfc2c5e3103375ae596d/Multi-label-Classification-of-Commit-Messages-using-Transfer-Learning.pdf) article


## Results
You can find all the results obtained in `commit_clasification_task.ipynb`.


## Running
- I used Google Colab, so if you run in other environments you will need to change the path to `train_2K.cvs` and `cleaned.test.msg`.
- Run `commit_clasification_task.ipynb`.
